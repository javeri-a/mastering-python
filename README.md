What is __pycache__ and .pyc files?

When you run a Python program, the interpreter does not directly execute the .py source code. Instead, it first converts your code into bytecode, which is a low-level, platform-independent format. This bytecode is then saved into .pyc files inside the __pycache__ folder. These files help Python execute programs faster because the code does not need to be recompiled every time you run it.

Key Points

.py = Your original source code written in Python.

Bytecode = An intermediate representation of your code created by the Python interpreter.

.pyc = Compiled bytecode files that Python stores for faster execution.

__pycache__ = The folder where .pyc files are saved automatically.

File naming format: filename.cpython-313.pyc

313 shows the Python version (e.g., Python 3.13).

Python uses .pyc files automatically, you donâ€™t run them manually.

If environment variable PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 is set, .pyc files will not be created.

Tuples in Python

A tuple is a collection data type in Python.

It looks like a list, but it is immutable (cannot be changed after creation).

Tuples are written using round brackets ().

Example:

fruits = ("apple", "banana", "mango")
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple

Key Points

Tuples are faster than lists.

Use when you want fixed data that should not change.

Indexing and slicing work the same as lists.

Useful for storing structured data, like coordinates or records.

Use Cases

Coordinates: (latitude, longitude)

Database records: (id, name, age)

Fixed categories: days of the week, months, etc.
